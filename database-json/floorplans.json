A formal dining room is the perfect spot for hosting dinner parties, while a separate living room is a great space for lessons or morning yoga, across the foyer from a formal work-from-home study. Upstairs, a spacious owner's suite includes a formal double-door entrance through a spacious sitting room, two wardrobe-loving walk-in closets, and a luxurious bath with both a free-standing soaking tub and sit-down shower. Bedroom 3 and 4 have walk-in closets and share a buddy bath, while Bedroom 2 will make a great guest room with an ensuite bath. You'll love the convenience of upstairs laundry. The lower level of The Oakton will entertain for years to come, with a huge recreation room open to the back, and opportunities to expand with an option den, media room, and full bath."
