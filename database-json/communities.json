The homes at Primrose Hill will be accessed via a private drive, nestled in a beautiful natural setting and well situated atop some of the city's highest ground. Truxtun Park, Annapolis's main city park and a flagship recreational destination, is a mere stone's throw. Downtown Annapolis is less than a five-minute drive, and Eastport - with its renowned Restaurant Row of waterfront fine dining - is but one minute away. Primrose Hill will be developed around its existing namesake manor home built in the 1760s, which will carefully be restored to its original grandeur. This historic landmark residence will create the community's stately first impression; the high architectural standards and timeless Craftsman style of the new homes at Primrose Hill will leave a lasting one. To be built exclusively by Craftmark Homes, the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore region's preeminent private builder of luxury homes for more than 25 years, Primrose Hill is truly the hidden gem that new construction rarely ever offers. As such, this fine planned community in Maryland's historic state capital will be treasured for generations to come.
