<p class="mt-2">Craftmark Homes is pleased to be introducing their quality craftsmanship and exceptional home designs at Burnt Pine Estates, a private residential community unlike any other with a uniquely enchanting close-in private setting developed through the vision of Craftmark Homes’ owner of over 30 years.</p>
<p class="mt-2">Your home plays many roles throughout your life, and now it’s more important than ever to love where you live. Each of our five single family homes is specially built on an exclusive selection of homesites on a private cul-de-sac, with lush green views in a charming wooded setting. All are remarkable for their signature Craftmark Homes architecture and gracious living designs. Our homeowners love the opportunity to be personally involved in each detail of creating their exceptionally designed home, and the ability to add customized designer features. </p>
<p class="mt-2">Our floor plans offer a vibrant lifestyle inside and out, with thoughtfully conceived spaces like the well-planned home office, a dedicated homework spot for the kids, a recreation room big enough to be your new gym or a movie night destination, plus a gourmet kitchen with all the right ingredients. <b>At 5,369+ square feet, the spacious Chevy Chase is ready to upgrade your lifestyle.</b></p>
<p class="mt-2">These spacious homesites provide an outdoor sanctuary with open-air green space that’s always available. Enjoy al fresco dining with a home cooked meal, rediscover favorite backyard activities, or spend an evening under the stars - all without leaving the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="mt-2">Living at Burnt Pine Estates means the arts and entertainment of Old Town Alexandria and Washington, D.C. are just minutes away. Located inside the beltway, enjoy easy access to major employment hubs, fabulous retail and dining options, and a wealth of recreation with major commuter routes like I-395, I-495, and King St. Metro nearby.
