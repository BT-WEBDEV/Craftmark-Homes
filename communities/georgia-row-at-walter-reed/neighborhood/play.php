<h4 class="font-weight-normal mt-2">Ready for a day on the town?</h4>
<p>Step out your front door onto Georgia Avenue and discover over 190,000 SF of retail planned at the new Walter Reed development, to include signature grocers, local restaurant groups, convenient fast casual dining, and boutique shopping. The quaint shopping and highly-rated dining of small-town Takoma Park is just a 15-minute stroll away, and downtown Silver Spring will be just 1.5 miles from your front door. Spend an afternoon shopping, catch up with friends over coffee (or cocktails!), and relish being able to walk home when the fun is over.</p>
