                        find themselves between a rock and a hard place.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">Do I simply sell on the open market and avoid the hassle of the entitlement process?
                        Or do I attempt to navigate the entitlement and development process myself so as not to leave
                        dollars on the table?</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">If you are a Land Owner or know someone else asking themselves these very questions,

                    <p class="text-l-blue mt-2"><strong>Our Proven Track Record</strong></p>
                    <p>Since our founding in 1991, Craftmark Homes has built more than 8,000 homes in the Washington, DC
                        area. We have won over 50 quality, building, and customer service awards, including the MBIA’s
                        “Builder of the Year” award 5 times, multiple QBW Builder Integrity awards, and have
                        consistently been ranked in the top 50 privately held companies by the Washington Business
                        Journal.</p>

                    <p class="text-l-blue mt-2"><strong>Our Financial Strength & Flexibility</strong></p>
                    <p>Our successful track record enables us to use our own equity to finance land purchases. We don’t
                        need interest bearing outside equity to buy your land, which allows us to offer you a better
                        deal than the competition and makes us a breeze to work with as well.</p>

                    <p class="text-l-blue mt-2"><strong>Our Team of Decision Makers & Closers</strong></p>
                    <p>We make all key decisions timely and efficiently from our headquarters in McLean, VA. We never
                        need time-consuming outside approval from partners across the country, as is typically the case
                        with larger, national builders. Our efficiency and ability get the job done and get you paid far
                        exceeds the industry standard.</p>

                    <p class="text-l-blue mt-2"><strong>Our Incredible Network</strong></p>
                    <p>In the nearly 30 years we’ve been in business, we’ve cultivated relationships with the largest
                        private and public developers in the mid-Atlantic region. We currently have 7 projects under
                        joint development across 2 states, 3 counties, and the District.</p>

                <h3 class="text-l-blue">Carver Place in Arlington, VA</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">To get a sense of our current production style and entitlement process, one need not
                    look further than down the street. Our recently completed community, Carver Place, in Arlington,
                    Virginia, developed in joint-venture with Elm Street Development, is a prime example of the vision,
                    quality, and follow-through for which Craftmark Homes and Elm Street Development are known. It
                    perfectly illustrates that we have the resources to tackle the most complicated of
                    entitlement/development projects.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">At Carver Place, not only did we achieve site plan approval within 2 years of contract
                    ratification, but we did so without taking the Seller on a “goose chase” through the entitlement
                    process (as the previous contract purchaser did) by overpromising on the density we thought we could
                    achieve and then subsequently underachieving in the same regard. When our offer was chosen, we
                    immediately went to work on a plan that we knew would be approved, and as a result are fully
                    settled, developed, built, and sold out just 4 years later.</p>
